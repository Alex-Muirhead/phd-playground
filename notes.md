# Notes

- [x] Currently built vertices as `x` and `y` coordinates. 
- [ ] Need to build "cell" coordinates, as averaged vertex coords.
- [x] Can select a random cell, and get the "center" coord
- [x] Can trace path from the cell along a random direction 
- [ ] Detect whether point is within the cell or not
- [ ] Detect which face need to move along to keep on the ray
